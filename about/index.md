Hey, my name's Andrew, and this is my website. I usually just post on Twitter but occasionally that just doesn't 'feel right', so I post here.

Love to post about music, baseball, politics, and occasionally some other stuff. And take requests!

Unrelated to posting: My day job requires transmuting abstract concepts into food. My night job requires the opposite. When not doing either of those, you can catch me exploring local (sub)urban spots, making noise behind my drum kit, or digging into medieval history podcasts. 

Drop me a line -
