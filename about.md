My name is Andrew and I do "something in marketing" at a nonprofit. I'm a lefty feminist who wonders why the first thing people say about themselves is often related to their job and also why identity politics often don't help me identify things.

I like Dragonball, writing words with lots of ascenders and descenders, cooly disaffected blog posts, twinkly emo, taking moody photos in urban places, and acronyms, among other things. Fairly certain I exist in the physical world, but I can never tell. I like to pet dogs and touch soft blankets. I have a few pictures up in my cubicle, which is neat. People often say nice things about me. Normally when someone writes something like that on their own website they have a link to the things that other people write, but I don't really have many of those handy so you'll just have to trust me on that.

I love getting pitched movie/story/article ideas, so please [send them to me][1]{:target="_blank"}!
