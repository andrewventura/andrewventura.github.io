summary: Trump is horrible — we know. But "Busters" need to remember that this (and every) election is bigger than one man, one office, or one branch of government.
---

It's hard to spill enough ink (digital or otherwise) on how bad Donald Trump's presidential agenda is (or would be). I'll avoid discussing his uninformed, xenophobic, contradictory, and wholly ridiculous "policies" (imagine me making air quotes for about twenty minutes straight when you read that) at length, because what more unsettling about this election isn't the ugly rhetoric, or the embrace of ignorance-as-a-virtue, or even the hordes of nasty racists/misogynists/etc. that have found themselves newly emboldened by a sympathetic candidate. To be sure, these things are all _horrible_, and are all are reason enough to keep Trump from the Oval Office, but what's most troubling are the less glamorous effects of a Trump Presidency: a Trump White House decimates Democrats' ability to blunt or outright kill odious legislation through constitutional means. What's more, solely repudiating Trump's presidential campaign does nothing to address both the underlying causes and cascading effects of his particularly vile brand of politics all up and down the structure of civil government.

### Beyond the White House

What doesn't get discussed, especially amongst the dissatisfied left-wing of the Democratic Party, is that the Presidency is about more than being "lobbyist-in-chief" and working toward a campaign-approved agenda — it's also about filling the Executive Branch's [constitutionally mandated][ai] role in the process of checks and balances. It's Civics 101, sure, but let's not understate the importance of one of the primary roles of the Executive - maintaining a constitutional bulwark against extreme legislation.

<aside class="pull-quote-right"><p>A Trump presidency doens't just mean building walls</p></aside>

Much has been made of Trump's potential role in [nominating justices to the Supreme Court][sc], but the sensationalism and abundant low-hanging fruit of the Presidential race causes Congressional races and issues to be primarily relegated to the sidelines (outside of those [tangentially related to the Presidential narrative][dws], that is.) It's rarely mentioned that, barring wild down-ballot Democratic turnout, [the GOP is likely to maintain its House and Senate majorities][s16]. 

A Trump presidency, then, doesn't just mean building walls, or deporting American citizens, or whatever else happens to be on his platform-of-the-day. It means that Democrats (and others on the left) lose one of two remaining institutional barriers to, among other things, those myriad "repeal Obamacare" votes [actually mattering][aca], the [Keystone Pipeline's construction][kxl], or [gutting the EPA's power to protect waterways][epa].

A Democrat (_any_ Democrat) in the White House at the very least maintains the last six years of divided government status quo; it is exceedingly difficult to see a President Hillary Clinton budge from a veto standpoint where her predecessor would not. And while upholding the status quo may disappoint those hoping for a liberal resurgence, at this point (sadly, perhaps) not losing ground feels like an accomplishment on its own.

Moreover, the _threat_ of a veto is often enough to prevent more fanciful policy from reaching the floor. A savvy president facing unified Congressional opposition can wield the threat of veto as a constitutional "ace in the hole", allowing her to maintain some degree of control over the legislative process and granting greater flexibility in winning legislative concessions from the opposition and tempering radical bills before they reach her desk.

The prevailing narrative of the presidential race always tends to emphasize drama, celebrity, and immediacy at the expense of nuance. (I realize I am not breaking any new ground here.) But now, when the majority party in Congress is paradoxically both buoyed and burdened by Donald Trump, the institutional consequences of retaining the presidency grow ever more dire. Even liberal dissidents within the Democratic Party, unsatisfied with their nominee, should come to terms with the fact that a Trump presidency foregos the possibility of smart political defense and effectively hands the GOP a legislative blank check.

### No Trump Is An Island

That blank check is all the more reason to remember that this election, like every election, is bigger than one candidate, or one office, or one (or hundreds of) horrible quips from a horrible narcissist. And it's always bigger than one level of government.

A year ago, endorsing Trump was considered political suicide (or, at the very least, self-mutilation). Today, the number of GOP representatives swearing fealty to their presidential nominee [continues to grow][gop]. Many of his now-supporters publicly denounced him as recently as a few months ago - but in a cruel twist of political fate, it's becoming politically and electorally dangerous _not_ to endorse Trump.

Political endorsements are more than just putting on a show and kissing the ring. They're also a way for politicians to maintain their connection to the power brokers who influence the electoral base. Savvy politicians know that in order to keep their seats (a legislator's top priority), they need to maintain access to their base's political animus. As upsetting as it may be, Trump is currently that animus. Ignoring the sway he currently has over the GOP's bread-and-butter voters is tantamount to letting crucial votes just slip away - any GOP politician worth his or her salt needs to tiptoe closer and closer to the Trump tent, often at the expense of previously held positions and statements. Worse yet, denouncing Trump at this point in the race could spell doom for even the most conservative of candidates - Trump supporters largely pay no mind to party affiliation when someone opposes him.

It remains to be seen whether Trumpian politics will remain as motivating a factor in the base after this election. It may not be particularly comforting, but if the past year has been any indication, it's probably not going away.

<aside class="pull-quote-left"><p>ignoring the underlying ripple effects of the Trump wave throughout the party is courting disaster down the line</p></aside>

In order to stay relevant in the GOP's New Trump Order, legislators will begin moving their Trumpism from the headlines and news shows into committee chambers - in order to maintain their tie to the "populist" wave of Trump, lawmakers will inevitably have to translate Trump-friendly sound bites into actual policy. 

So while at the moment Trump's non-sequiturs are a highly troublesome hodge-podge of coded racism, narcissistic power grabs, and ignorant hedonism, they can also be read as a terrifying roadmap of the coming election cycles. His true lasting impact may not be gold trim around the White House, but rather a hastening and amplification of the rightward shift in the GOP's agenda, particularly amongst vulnerable members of Congress - especially on hot-button, high-visibility issues like immigration and trade.

So while it's important to rebuke the nonsense that comes from the candidate's mouth, ignoring the underlying ripple effects of the Trump wave throughout the party is courting disaster down the line.

If liberals should have learned anything from the past two midterm elections, it's that they can't expect the infiltration of fringe-right orthodoxy into the mainstream of the GOP to fizzle out — memories of 2010's electoral embarrassment at the hands of the Tea Party should send shivers down progressives' spines. These movements, outlandish as they may seem in even modestly blue districts, are not just going to go away. And unless the Democrats (and those to the left of them) want to watch idly as the Trumpian approach — the brazenly, unapologetically post-facts approach — to policy and legislation further lodge itself in the mainstream policy apparatus within the GOP, they're going to need to coalesce around a movement that rebukes it at every level of government, not just in the national headlines. 

That's going to take some serious work. Democrats already have to deal with serious [uphill battles][to] in non-presidential elections as it is - unless they can parlay their recent [anti-Trump successes][hrcdt] in the presidential race into a working strategy down-ballot, they're going to be facing more and more GOP candidates who kowtow to the fringe right to get elected. 

So, to those brought under the Democratic Party's umbrella by the Sanders campaign; to those thoroughly dissatisfied with the nominee; to those mulling third-party protest votes; remember: it isn't enough just keeping Donald J. Trump out of the White House - it's also about keeping him and his particularly vile brand of politics out of the entire system altogether.
