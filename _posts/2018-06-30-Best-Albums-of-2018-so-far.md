Feeling good about this one, yall. It's June 30th. We're exactly halfway through the year (going by months, at least). That means I can talk about MY FAVORITE RECORDS OF THE YEAR, SO FAR, HALFWAY, and be totally on point. Usually I do these at less satisfying points in the year - this is a nice, even split.

Anyway, here's what I've dug so far. <a href="#" onclick="window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=.@andrewjventura%20you%20forgot%20about%20this,%20dummy:    ','name','width=550,height=420,left=100,top=100')">Let me know</a> what I've missed.

#### **Pianos Become the Teeth** - _Wait for Love_ ####

This is, hands down, my favorite record to come out this year. _Wait for Love_ is the work of a band unafraid to _know_ itself. Where the band's excellent 2014 release _Keep You_ proved to be a major evolution in the band's sound, _Wait for Love_ is better seen as an exploration of exactly what that evolution means. _Keep You_ traded the frenetic, screamo-tinged post-hardcore of the band's early work for more measured melancholy. _Wait for Love_, however, outwardly maintains much of _Keep You_'s texture and melody, but focuses its efforts on reflecting inward, diving deep into the band's internal machinations and finally drawing from that well a lush, captivating, and - most critically - _honest_ record.

#### **Lume* - _Wrung Out_ ####

A brooding, at times menacing record, _Wrung Out_'s sheer sonic density caught me by surprise. It lumbers through a primodial haze with something between a shamble and a lurch, the heaviness of guitar and bass permeating sinew and bone until all is awash in sonic void. It culminates into a slow-burning fever pitch, subsuming everything and allowing it to blithely unravel.

#### **Svalbard** - _It's Hard To Have Hope_ ####
![Translation Lost, 2018](/img/s-ihthh.jpg)

Wild, aggressive, righteously furious hardcore with a **strong* feminist bent. It's pure, it's from the heart, and it kicks so, so, so much ass. Don't sleep on it.

#### **Tangled Hair** - _We Do What We Can_ ####

I was pleasantly surprised to see these guys drop a record this year, especially because it came out when I was in England. Their emo-influenced noodle soup, in the vein of fellow UK mathematicians TTNG and Colour, is as tasty as ever through these 9 tracks.

Here are a few more that I've enjoyed this year:

- **Jon Hopkins** - _Singularity_
- **Standards** - _Standards_
- **Culture Abuse** - _Bay Dreams   _
- **Animal Flag** - _Void Ripper_
- **Kendrick Lamar** (+ others) - _Black Panther_
- **Harm's Way** - _Posthuman_
- **Vein** - _Errorzone_
- **mouse on the keys** - _tres_
