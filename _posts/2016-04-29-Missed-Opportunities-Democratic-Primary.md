summary: At yet another pivotal political moment, the Democratic Party pays lip service to populist currents and reinforces the status quo at its own peril.

First things first: I'm a Bernie Sanders supporter (and donor). But after last Tuesday's routing, I've come to accept it: the race is pretty much over. The delegate lead is, as the Clinton campaign has asserted (even before it truly was), nigh-insurmountable.
<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup>

But that simple statement has been dogged for months by the factional controversy that's played out in every caucus and rally, in every thinkpiece and tweet posted after each state's results are tallied.

There's no question as to which candidate has the favor of many of the party's power players. By and large, the Democratic Party, as an organization, has scarcely made an effort to deflect accusations of favoritism. The biggest names and deepest pockets have made their choice clear; in much the same way, the inherent unfairness of the superdelegate system [is a feature, not a bug][1]{:target="_blank"}. 

But it goes beyond institutional preferences and barriers, and more importantly, beyond just the Presidential race. Recent news of the party "establishment" [actively blocking progressive Congressional candidates][2]{:target="_blank"} is symptomatic of the party's deep-seated (if somewhat ironic) conservatism.

The greatest danger isn't just some temporary primary bitterness or wonky optics. The party's reticence to take even modest populist stances isn't news. and upset its big donors and stakeholders, but rather what that does to party factions with considerably less pull at the elite level: by proferring established and "safe" candidates in the name of incremental progress, the party is implicitly (and, in some more troubling cases, explicitly) rejecting their increasingly vocal left wing.

While that might not be politically important for the Democrats in the very short term (or, pessimistically, as far forward as 2018-2020), the [growing unease with the capitalist status quo among millenials][3]{:target="_blank"} should keep Democratic elites up at night when visualizing their electoral roadmaps eight or more years down the road.

### The Current Opportunity, and How to Miss It ###

While the Republican Party spends night after night tearing itself down brick by bright orange brick, the Democratic Party has spent the lion's share of its own primary pretending that the rules of the game haven't changed since the '90s.

Let's put it another way: after facing eight years of near-lockstep Republican opposition, after taking loss after electoral loss to a unified Republican bloc vigorously animated by the Tea Party, the Democrats have responded to the opportunity presented by the GOP's Trumpian identiy crisis by...staying the course.

If the Democratic refrain since 2010 has been that liberal policy efforts are halted by GOP obstructionists in Congress, then surely this political moment, much like in 2008, should be an opportunity for the Democrats to forge a stronger, broader, and more capable liberal coalition in light of the widening cracks in the Republican bloc, right?

Well, no, not really. Actually, quite the opposite. The Democratic Party's response has largely been to play extremely safe, with Hillary Clinton seeking to associate herself with President Obama's agenda and record as much as possible. Incrementalism is the new progress, they insist.

Compare then-Senator Obama's [soaring campaign rhetoric in 2008][4]{:target="_blank"} to Clinton's current reluctance to lean any ["farther left than most moderate Democrats would like to see"][5]{:target="_blank"}.

Here and in many other instances Clinton - and by proxy, mainstream Democratic power players - hide behind "pragmatism" in order to silence dissent from the left. 

The system, they say, requires a player adept at navigating its inherent biases. The campaign, its champions in the party, liberal talking heads, and oft-cited columnists in major publications co-opt populism to a point - but when faced with a candidate who wholly embraces it, they withdraw and trot out headlines with words like "pipe dreams" or "[pie-in-the-sky][6]". The system, indeed.

These kinds of attacks against the Sanders campaign usually involve Clinton asserting her "moderate" bona fides (_usually_), citing concerns of "electability" and deflecting any criticism by pointing at the scary Republican candidates.

Suffice to say that these reassurances are cold comfort for those who have soured on the Democratic Party's habit of settling for (and celebrating) the crumbs gained in policy battles.
