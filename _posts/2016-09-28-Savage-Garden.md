One of my favorite things to do with reddit is to find random, preferably low-activity subreddits in some obscure topic or interest. I'll subscribe, and hopefully have each one pay off with a quality post in some oddball topic. So while shuffling while catching up on Dragon Ball Super fansubs, I found and subscribed to [/r/Savage Garden][reddit], a community of 12,000 or so folks united by a love of 90s-00s middle-school-slow-dance jams -- oh, wait, no, it's not that at all. It's actually a community full of carnivorous plant enthusiasts - and somehow that's a hundred times better than a bunch of folks stoked on posting old live footage of _Truly Madly Deeply_.

So, naturally, I started reading up on carnivorous plants - did you know that the Venus flytrap's name [comes from the dirty minds of 18th century naturalists][cpfaq1]? They're apparently native to the Carolinas (who knew?), and are only moderately challenging to care for. Now, being someone who isn't afraid of a moderate challenge, and also being someone who thinks carnivorous plants are cool as hell, I figured I'd try my hand at growing a few.

I went to my local nursery and grabbed a pitcher plant (most likely _Sarracenia Rosea_) and a VFT (_Dionaea muscipula_). Got some sphagnum peat moss, perlite, and a few clay pots. Repotted them and set 'em out in the full sun. It's been a week, and I'm not sure if this is premature or not, but I think the fact that they aren't shriveled and dead yet is testament to my nurturing spirit and natural green thumb. What's more, I'm pretty sure new leaves/traps are emerging from Typhon (the VFT, so named for the [mythological Greek giant][typh] with a hundred snakes growing from his shoulders), so I'd say that's a plus. I think Kershaw (the pitcher plant. Get it??) is also growing a fresh pitcher. Dope!

I can already tell that this is one of those weird things/hobbies where a bit of success early on only encourages the madness. Are there crazy carnivorous plant people, the same way there are crazy cat/dog people? I guess we'll know if I start making slow-mo/time-lapse montages of insect kills.

Keep it locked to see just how many Savage Garden (like the band) puns I can make while growing these things.
