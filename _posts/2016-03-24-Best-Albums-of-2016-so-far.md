We're nearly a quarter done with the year, which means that I have to make a list, or something. Here's what's been spinning that features a nice "2016" next to a Â© somewhere on the packaging - or on the streaming page on whatever streaming service I'm still getting a free trial from.

_I'll also update this once I have a chance to write a blurb when I'm not at work._


* Into It. Over it. - _Standards_
* Lil B - _Thugged Out Pissed Off_
* Hinds - _Leave Me Alone_
* Kanye West - _The Life of Pablo_
* Porches - _Pool_
* David Bowie - _Blackstar_
* Kendrick Lamar - _untitled unmastered._
* Wild Nothing - _Life of Pause_
* Pinegrove - _Cardinal_
* DIIV - _Is the Is Are_


And a few that I haven't spent enough time with but would like to:

* Ty Segall - _Emotional Mugger_
* The Body - _No One Deserves Happiness_ and _One Day You Will Ache Like I Ache_ (with Full of Hell)
* Boris with Merzbow - _Gensho_
* Savages - _Adore Life_
